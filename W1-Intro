History
  543 Million Years Ago we just had animals floating in water
  Not too many different types of animals
  There is then suddenly a huge explosion in the no. of species in Animals
  Increased Diversity- predatory prey relationships etc. started evolving
  People believe this change occured because of the coming of "eyes"
  "Eyes" => finding prey to eat. Biological Arms race
  Vision was the root!
  Renaissance:Camera Obscura by Leonardo da Vinci- very simple architecture
  There is a hole to capture light and some kind of reflection to capture
